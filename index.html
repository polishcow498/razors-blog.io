        Hi! My name is Abdulrahman "Razor" Faris (don't ask abt the name btw, im from iraq), and I am an intermediate front-end web developer. You might be wondering, "What is a front-end web developer?"<br>
        Well, it's basically the maker of a website's structure, design, and functionality. I only know how to make the structure + design of a website, and that's all, ok?<br>
        Anyways, I post my blogs weekly and improve them every time. I may be able to add a feedback bar sooner or later, but, for know, that's all. See you next week, if you'll remember anyways.
